# In case of no barrel left, choice move to the enemy or against the enemy by comparing the rum left of ships

# Fire cannonballs with prediction of the movement of enemy ship
  Consider the turns to impact


# Place mines  with prediction of the movement of enemy ship



### DONE ###
# Dodge cannonballs
# Dodge mines
# Fire cannonballs with SIMPLE prediction of the movement of enemy ship

# Ships seem to be frozen
