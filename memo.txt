### PLAN ###

# Coordinate three ships

# Make strategy to trap enemy ships

# Fire cannonballs with prediction of the movement of enemy ship
  Consider the turns to impact

# prioritize speed higher


# Place mines  with prediction of the movement of enemy ship

# Resolve stuck at the edge or corner
  Need to implement the process for the edge, which are speed and location in prediction method

# Change priority by the rum left of the ship


### DONE ###
# In case of no barrel left, choice move to the enemy or against the enemy by comparing the rum left of ships

# Prioritize WAIT less

# Dodge cannonballs
# Dodge mines
# Fire cannonballs with SIMPLE prediction of the movement of enemy ship

# Ships seem to be frozen
  move command is issued properly
  maybe need manual control
